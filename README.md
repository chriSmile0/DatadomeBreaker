# DatadomeBreaker

## Disclaimer 
- Not use this for malicious Bot, thanks ;)

## Why
- Because Datadome is the new mainstream guardian of differents popular website
  (Mcdonalds, Supermarket Drive, E-Commerce website, etc..)
- But this tool have a failure (GeeTest Captcha is easy to break, that's a client side failure)
- This tool check the server side also and :package `puppeteer` have good 
  answer to this problem 

## How 
- Pixels analysis of a **screenshot** take with `puppeteer` 
- This analysis return the step between the **puzzle_piece** and the **target_place**
it exists some projects on **GitHub** who use the request system for pass the Datadome
test, if my final version don't work I think I would use these ideas.


## Usage 
- `mv ... `**OR**`cp WebsitesExamples/{Example}/* /local_server/path/{dest_folder}`
- `cd libpng_usage && gcc -Wall -Werror  libpng_example.c libpng_example.h print_png.c -o print_png -lpng -g && cd ..`
- `node break.js` -> that's enough ;)
